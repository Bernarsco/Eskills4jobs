  <h1 style="color: lightblue">What is Lorem Ipsum</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</b> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <u>specimen book.</u> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <em>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,</em> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
